Topic: Medicine

## Overview/Introduction/Context
* Healthcare has enabled the prospering of civilizations since the beginning of time.
* Healthcare is a spectrum of concepts which conjoins factors including diagnosis, prevention, cures, treatments, etc.
* Technology has and will continue to make up a significant percentage of success in the health industry  the info you have gathered regarding the software + hardware technologies you found in your topic.

## Part A: existing technology

* Least complex

###### Healthcare apps

Apps looked into: WebMD, Epocrates, DynaMed

Findings: These apps generally provide brief medical care including symptom checks, treatments, listings, etc.
Can be helpful to temporarily maintain health when in absence of a doctor alongside identifying healthcare products and researching disease.
These apps revolve around one’s general health and only partially align with the guidelines of healthcare (diagnosis in particular).

* Mildly complex

###### Healthcare gadgets

Gadgets looked into: Bone health gadget, brain activity gadget, gut health gadget

Findings: These technologies use subordinate technologies (vibrations, body activity, testers…) to compile bodily components and improve numerous existing factors. This, in turn, can impact everyday patterns/habits.
These gadgets further align themselves with the healthcare system by being able to provide potential treatments, cures, preventions, and more

* Most complex

###### Hospital equipment

Machines looked into: Defibrillators, anesthesia machines, patient monitors
Findings: The technologies are made up of numerous supporting features and similarly to gadgets, compile different health components and improve/find solutions to given health statuses.
These machines revolve around one’s specific health and thoroughly  align with the guidelines of healthcare including treatments, cures, prevention, diagnosis…

## Part B: possible future technology

###### Advanced blood tester
A common common blood technology currently used in measuring blood activity, particularly blood pressure, is a blood pressure monitor. I want to create an improved version of this where the monitor will be able to measure other factors pertaining to blood.
###### Diagnostic body scanner
MRI technology is essentially a body scanner, however, the machine has potential risks including magnetic field and radio frequency risk. Additionally, the scans are not covered when they are not medically necessary. I want to create a body scanner which is guaranteed to be safe and inexpensive to use.
###### Tissue regeneration technology
There is currently medicine which is associated with faster and efficient healing. I want to expand on this technology and compile a system of devices to create a regenerative machine which can be used in critical conditions.
###### Chemical imbalance medicine
I want to expand on medicine which exists to balance chemicals in the brain. Mental issues take up a majority of the world and to research more efficient medical alternatives would naturally lessen the effect.
###### Artificial 3d organ printers
These printers would be able to create functioning organs in replacement of damaged ones at a faster rate.
###### Robotics
Robots are commonly used in manufacturing, packaging, transport, exploration, surgery, weaponry, research, safety, etc.
Health wise, robots can be used to perform a human’s job at a more efficient and faster rate
This could speed up healing process in patients the same way the other listed technologies are able to
Robotics essentially combines all the guidelines associated with healthcare making this field  and its technology greatly in demand in regards to successful regeneration.
