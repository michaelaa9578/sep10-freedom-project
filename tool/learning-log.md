* Links you used today (websites, videos, etc)

  * My partner and I created a [wireframe](https://wireframe.cc/zawn6r) to have a rough draft of our project. This is to help us envision certain parts in a general way but as we gradually continue to edit our content to be more thorough, we'll add more details to that original layout (or even completely change it).
  * [JS Bin](https://jsbin.com/betaqigope/edit?html,output)
  
* Things you tried, progress you made, etc
  
  * After completing our plan, we decided to also plan our individual roles in the project. For example, HTML is my responsibility while the CSS is my partner's. Some parts, however, we decided to work on together as they were complex tasks which involved their own seprate individual roles.
  * In terms of HTML code, I was able to test out a few bootstrap components, specifically including cards, navbars, and listgroups. Ahough, I wasn't able to properly execute these components in [JS Bin](xhttps://jsbin.com/betaqigope/edit?html,output), I was able to get a rough idea of what I wanted to incorporate into the project. 
  
* Challenges, a-ha moments, etc

* Questions you still have
* What you're going to try next
