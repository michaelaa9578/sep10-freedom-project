### Content

I worked on my freedom project for a continuous week. I focused on prioritizing the MVP where detail in my project would be evenly distributed compared to a project with more attention to detail in only certain areas. In my MVP, I made to sure to follow the following MVP timeline which I have structured:

* 4/16: Finish plan.md
* 4/17: Look for basic templates and gather research to put into the chosen template
* 4/18: Customizing html and css based on research and establish bootstrap components which I'll use in the final prototype
* 4/19: Finish customizing template and start working on Aframe simulation
* 4/19-4/29: Work on Aframe simulation and input blog links
* 4/30: Check to make sure all MVP requirments are met in the project

##### Struggles
I struggled to follow my timeline being that I struggled with the content itself. My initial plan, which can be seen on my wireframes for the project, consisted of a carousel (my primary problem) as well as a differently structured mobile frame. For the carousel, I struggled mainly to find appropriate code to input into my project. I used W3Schools for the entirety of the project, hence, I used the code on that website for my project to create a slideshow. I found the entire process complicated especially given the fact that I had to input several scripts to make it functional. I did this for several other websites until I eventually realized that I was wasting too much time on only a single part of my plan. I decided to eventually find alternative components to replace the slideshow and that allowed me to work on other significant parts of the project. I had the same problem with following my mobile model and therefore also decided to alternate my model from the original wireframe. 

### EDP

I'm to stages 6 and 7 of the engineering design process where I test and test and evaluate my prototype as well as improve as needed. I have finished creating my final prototype which was the fifth/previous stage of my project. During these current stages of the project, I'll test to see the effectiveness of my project and highlight the dysfunctional aspects of it to later consider it for potential solutions. Once I complete testing out my code, I'll move to the final eighth stage of the engineering design process where I communicate my end results with my peers.  

### Skills

One skill I was able to work on throughout the project was logic. I was able to gain this skill through trying to incorporate the carousel component. As it started to consume a lot of my time and divert my attention from other important parts of the project, I decided that the logical choice would be to replace the carousel with another feature instead of continuously working on it without guaranteed results. I was able to utilize this skill in my everyday life, especially in decision making. When deciding on my courses for next year, I decided to choose biology or chemistry being that chemistry would most likely overwhelm me in the long run. This decision has already saved me mental strain in that I don't have to focus on a subject that doesn't particularly interest me. Another skill I was able to work on throughout the project was time management, although I didn't perfect the skill. I was able to create a plan which, for the most part, I thoroughly followed making the project less overwhelming to fully complete. I was able to incorporate this skill into completing homework in other classes. The remainder of the marking period, I was able to hand in most of my work raising my overall independent practice grade.   

### Reflection
I look forward to finding ways to improve my freedom project through feedback which other students and I will exchange.
