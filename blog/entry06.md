### Content

I worked on my freedom project for a continuous week. I focused to prioritize the MVP where detail in my project would be evenly distributed compared to a project with more attention to detail in only certain areas. In my MVP, I made to sure to follow the following timeline which I have structured:

* 4/16: Finish plan.md
* 4/17: Look for basic templates and gather research to put into the chosen template
* 4/18: Customizing html and css based on research
* 4/19: Finish customizing template and start working on Aframe simulation
* 4/19-4/29: Work on Aframe simulation and input blog links
* 4/30: Check to make sure all MVP requirments are in the project

##### Struggles
I struggled to follow my timeline being that I struggled with the content itself. My initial plan, which can be seen on my wireframes for the project, consisted of a carousel (my primary problem) as well as a differently structured mobile frame. For the carousel, I struggled mainly to find appropriate code to input into my project. I used W3 Schools for the entirety of the project, hence, I used the code on that website for my project to create a slideshow. I found the entire process complicating especially given the fact that I had to input several scripts to make it functional. I did this for several other websites until I eventually realized that I was wasting too much time on only a single part of my plan. I decided to eventually find alternative components to replace the slideshow and that allowed me to work on other signifcant parts of the project. I had the same problem with following my mobile model and therefore also decided to alternate my model from the original wireframe.

### Skills

One skill I was able to work on throughout the project was logic. I was able to gain this skill through trying to incorporate the carousel component.   

### Reflection
I look forward to continue finding new potential solutions even with an existing primary solution to ensure the continuation of medicine.
