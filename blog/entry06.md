### Content

I worked on my freedom project for a continuous week. I focused to prioritize the MVP where detail in my project would be evenly distributed over a project with more attention to detail in only certain areas. In my MVP, I made sure to  

#### Struggles
I struggled to actually input my tool into the code which I was using. In turn, I was unable to physically display the code to see what I was working with. I would continuosly add components blindly. This made it difficult to see what components were fit for what scenarios.

Engineering Design Process
I have moved on to the fourth step of the engineering design process which means that I'm organizing my information to devise solutions to my given problem in step 1 (brainstorming). I have already brainstormed possible solutions which means that I have to plan the most efficient solution. During this part of the project, I begin to execute information which I have found through brainstorming. By testing these ideas, I'll be able to better structure a final solution to my topic of medicine by seeing which body of code is most effective. Once I complete testing out different code, I plan to create a prototype using my tool (step 5).

### Skills

One skill I was able to work on throughout this stage of the project was paying attention to detail. Having to pick a particular tool out of a wide variety of other tools required having to rule out certain aspects in my plan. For example, when looking through Tailwind (a tool), I had to focus on the type of code which was being utilized to gather an overall idea of the tool. Eventually, I realized that Tailwind, as I mentioned in my content, focused more so on organization rather than model designing which I happen to be more interested in and which Aframe (my chosen tool) was more involved with. Focusing on smaller components helped me in other situations outside of those in SEP. When I first started babysitting for my niece, I was solely focused on playing with her and making her happy, which even though her happiness is just as important, I should have also been focused on the smaller tasks such as regulalry cleaning her bowls, observing her sleep schedule, looking for any abnormal behaviors, etc. These smaller tasks make up for her overall development which I eventually realized in the midst of tinkering. Through tinkering, I'm now able to efficiently care for my niece resulting in her being both happy and healthy.

### Reflection
I look forward to continue finding new potential solutions even with an existing primary solution to ensure the continuation of medicine.
