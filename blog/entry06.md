### Content

I worked on my freedom project for a continuous week. I focused to prioritize the MVP where detail in my project would be evenly distributed compared to a project with more attention to detail in only certain areas. In my MVP, I made to sure to follow the following timeline which I have structured:

* 4/16: Finish plan.md
* 4/17: Look for basic templates and gather research to put into the chosen template
* 4/18: Customizing html and css based on research
* 4/19: Finish customizing template and start working on Aframe simulation
* 4/19-4/29: Work on Aframe simulation and input blog links
* 4/30: Check to make sure all MVP requirments are in the project

##### Struggles
I struggled to follow my timeline being that I struggled with the content itself. My initial plan, which can be seen on my wireframes for the project, consisted of a carousel (my primary problem) as well as a differently structured mobile frame. For the carousel, I struggled mainly to find appropriate code to input into my project. I used W3 Schools for the entirety of the project, hence, I used the code on that website for my project to create a slideshow. I found the entire process complicating especially given the fact that I had to input several scripts to make it functional. I did this for several other websites until I eventually realized that I was wasting too much time on only a single part of my plan. I decided to eventually find alternative components to replace the slideshow and that allowed me to work on other signifcant parts of the project. I had the same problem with following my mobile model and therefore also decided to alternate my model from the original wireframe. 

### EDP

I'm moving to the final eigth stage of the engineering design process where I communicate my end results with my peers. 

### Skills

One skill I was able to work on throughout the project was logic. I was able to gain this skill through trying to incorporate the carousel component. As it started to consume a lot of my time and divert my attention from other important parts of the project, I decided that the logical choice would be to replace the carousel with another feature instead of continuosly working on it without guaranteed results. I was able to utilize this skill in my everyday life, especially in decision making. When deciding on my courses for next year, I decided to choose biology over chemistry being that chemistry would most likely overwhelm me in the long run. This decison has already saved me mental strain in that I don't have to focus on a subject that doesn't particulalry interest me. Another skill I was able to work on throughout the project was time managament, although I didn't perfect the skill. I was able to create a plan which, for the most part, I thoroughly followed making the project less overwhelming to fully complete. I was able to incorporate this skill into completeing homework in other classes. The remainder of the marking period, I was able to hand in most of my work raising my overall indepedent practice grade.   

### Reflection
I look forward to finding ways to improve my freedom project through feedback which other students and I will exchange.
