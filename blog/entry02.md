##### 11/30/23

### Topic: Healthcare 

#### Searches

<p> <li> My first google search: healthcare apps </li> </p>

Findings: The first app I looked into was [WebMD](https://www.imedicalapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/WebMD2.jpg). This app was able to provide brief medical care including symptom checks, treatments, listings, etc. With these factors in consideration, the app can be beneficial in temporarily maintaining health when in absence of a medical professional. Additionally, the app consists of various sections and labels which makes navigation easily comprehensible. In short, this application is easy to use and efficient in its goal to manage health. 
  
<p> <li> My second google search: health assessment applications </li> </p>
Findings: The second app I looked into was [Epocrates](https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10278-017-9977-2/MediaObjects/10278_2017_9977_Fig1_HTML.gif). This app also provides brief medical care but with a greater variety of topics including pill ids, drugs, diseases, etc.
Can be helpful in identifying healthcare products and researching disease. 

<p> <li> My third google search: health information apps </li> </p> 
Third app looked into was [DynaMed](https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple122/v4/39/24/5c/39245c97-2624-4f40-b91d-4b562646806a/21ac9d05-0f86-4c2d-a130-1559e15f4207_Simulator_Screen_Shot_-_iPhone_13_Pro_Max_-_2022-10-26_at_09.16.09.png/460x0w.webp).
This app provides articles on medical conditions. 
Can be helpful in learning about certain medical properties.
Consists of images for visualization of the given information for better comprehension
Consists of organizatory labels to divide sections and provide efficient navigation

#### Tools

<p> <li> My first google search: health gadgets </li> </p>
Findings: Blood pressure monitor, smartwatch, water bottle, brain sensing headband, air purifier, etc.
My initial findings were vague and everyday use items. I decided to specify my second google search to find items which were directly correlated with your health (specifics including 
brain activity, blood pressure, skin health, gut health, etc) 

<p> <li> My second google search:  Bone health gadget </li> </p> 
First gadget looked into: https://pharmashots.com/public/images/20211116013034_ogImage_43.jpg (OsteoBoost)
This product uses vibration technology to improve density and overall bone strength.  
My upcoming goal was to find even more specific health technology which obviously excluded bone health. 

<p> <li> My third google search: Brain activity gadget </li> </p> 
Second gadget looked into: https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_2496-e1546831644832.jpg  
This product connects to an app in order to measure brain activity. This, in turn, can positively impact everyday patterns/habits.  
My upcoming goal was to continue targeting particular health factors in order to eventually compile a system of devices to support numerous factors. 
 
<p> <li> My fourth google search: Gut health gadget </li> </p>  
Third gadget looked into: https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71WTz1Iu86L._AC_UF1000,1000_QL80_.jpg (FoodMarble Aire digestive breath tester) 
This product uses a portable breath tester to match foods to sustain your digestive system.
I have so far compiled gut, bone, and brain health products in an effort to create a spectrum of available devices to sustain oneâ€™s health.


### Engineering Design Process
I am currently on the second step of the engineering design process. This means I'm conducting research on the given problem in step 1. I have already defined my problem which is the fear of adaptability. Biologically, humans often perceieve uncertainty as a threat which is why change is feared by many. Technology, particularly electronic, is a very recentley developed conception that's gradually taking over the globe. Multiple concerns arise from this rapid evolution (mostly the product of fear). Will AI surpass human beings? Will cybersecurity worsen with time? Is technology more harmful than helpful? Although these questions can't yet be fully answered, I'm left to finish my second step in the engineering design process which combines research to try to find any answers. Eventually, once I collect information on the given topic, I'll brainstorm and formulate a plan to create possible solutions to my problem. This will be the third step to the design engeering process.

### Skills
Although I'm in the raw stages of the freedom project, I've already aqquired a few beneficial skills, one of which covers project management. As I'm beginning to write my blog to documenet my project from start to finish, I learned to structure my work in a way that's easy to comprehend. Before working on my project, I found projects, especially essays, extremely challenging to organize. I wouldn't know how or when to transition from one subject to another. It was abundantly akward having to switch from a depressing to positive tone in my english class discussions for example. During the process of project management, I was forced to continuously practice connecting, layering, and modifying certain parts of my claim in order to align with my sub claims. In the end, this skill was able to earn me a better summative grade for english and continue to maintain an evident subject in my freedom project.

Another skill I was able to achieve through this project so far was decision making. I've always struggled making choices growing up. I found it hard to believe how people made roughly 35,000 decisions in a day when it took me hours to make a single one. As I've stated before, I was overly conflicted when given a list of occupations to choose from in the very beginning of the freedom project. I recognize now that I took too much time considering other minor details when I should've been focusing on the big picture. I had a similar problem with math. I would almost always overcomplicate my solution by using various formulas for a problem that simply required one. While it's of course helpful to finalize your work by using alternatives to check your methods, overanalyzing can overwwhelm you and in time drain you. Through this project, I learned to examine a situation to a certain degree which in turn helped my decision making. In terms of math, I was able to write down a straightforward answer making it easier for both me and my teacher's comprehension.

### Reflection
I look forward to gaining various other new skills throughout this project. I've learned more than I thought I was capable of. I hope I continue to surprise myself while also further fueling my passion for medicine.
