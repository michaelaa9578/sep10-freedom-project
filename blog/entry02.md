# Entry 2: The information I have gathered and organized regarding software/hardware technologies in relation to my topic
##### 11/30/23

### Topic: Healthcare 

### Intro/Context/Overview:

Healthcare has enabled the prospering of civilizations since the beginning of time.
Healthcare is a spectrum of concepts which conjoins factors including diagnosis, prevention, cures, treatments, etc.
Technology has and will continue to make up a significant percentage of success in the health industry the info you have gathered regarding the software + hardware technologies you found in your topic. 


### Categories:


###### Least complex

Healthcare apps
Apps looked into: WebMD, Epocrates, DynaMed
Findings: 
* These apps generally provide brief medical care including symptom checks, treatments, listings, etc. 
* Can be helpful to temporarily maintain health when in absence of a doctor alongside identifying healthcare products and researching disease.
* These apps revolve around one’s general health and only partially align with the guidelines of healthcare (diagnosis in particular). 

###### Mildly complex

Healthcare gadgets
Gadgets looked into: Bone health gadget, brain activity gadget, gut health gadget 
Findings: 
* These technologies use subordinate technologies (vibrations, body activity, testers…) to compile bodily components and improve numerous existing factors. This, in turn, can impact everyday patterns/habits. 
* These gadgets further align themselves with the healthcare system by being able to provide potential treatments, cures, preventions, and more. 

###### Most complex

Hospital equipment
Machines looked into: Defibrillators, anesthesia machines, patient monitors
Findings: 
* The technologies are made up of numerous supporting features and similarly to gadgets, compile different health components and improve/find solutions to given health statuses. 
* These machines revolve around one’s specific health and thoroughly align with the guidelines of healthcare including treatments, cures, prevention, diagnosis…

### Engineering Design Process
I have moved on to the third step of the engineering design process which means that I'm organizing my information to devise solutions to my given problem in step 1 (brainstorming). I have already defined my problem and researched it which leaves me in the planning stage. During this part of the project, I begin to consider potential solutions and organize my information in a way where different topics correlate themselves to form a new idea. Once I complete step three of the EDP, I plan to choose a final solution (step 4). 

### Skills

One skill I was able to continuosly work on throughout this stage of the project was organization. By having to organize my healthcare apps and gadgets into ways which link to potenial solutions helped me to correlate other aspects outside of SEP. In my English class, for example, I was tasked to connect a colonial setting with modern characters. Being that the two concepts clealry contrast, having to connect them was bound to be difficult. After this project, however, I'm now capable of linking numerous varities. Now, I constantly combine tones, dialact, and other factors in character development and different plots. Another skill I was able to achieve through this project so far was creativity. With having to create correlations  

### Reflection
I look forward to gaining various other new skills throughout this project. I've learned more than I thought I was capable of. I hope I continue to surprise myself while also further fueling my passion for medicine.
