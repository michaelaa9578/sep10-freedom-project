# Entry 2: The information I have gathered and organized regarding software/hardware technologies in relation to my topic
##### 11/30/23

### Topic: Healthcare 

### Intro/Context/Overview:

Healthcare has enabled the prospering of civilizations since the beginning of time.
Healthcare is a spectrum of concepts which conjoins factors including diagnosis, prevention, cures, treatments, etc.
Technology has and will continue to make up a significant percentage of success in the health industry  the info you have gathered regarding the software + hardware technologies you found in your topic.


### Categories:


###### Least complex

Healthcare apps
Apps looked into: WebMD, Epocrates, DynaMed
Findings: 
* These apps generally provide brief medical care including symptom checks, treatments, listings, etc. 
* Can be helpful to temporarily maintain health when in absence of a doctor alongside identifying healthcare products and researching disease.
* These apps revolve around one’s general health and only partially align with the guidelines of healthcare (diagnosis in particular). 

###### Mildly complex

Healthcare gadgets
Gadgets looked into: Bone health gadget, brain activity gadget, gut health gadget 
Findings: 
* These technologies use subordinate technologies (vibrations, body activity, testers…) to compile bodily components and improve numerous existing factors. This, in turn, can impact everyday patterns/habits. 
* These gadgets further align themselves with the healthcare system by being able to provide potential treatments, cures, preventions, and more. 

###### Most complex

Hospital equipment
Machines looked into: Defibrillators, anesthesia machines, patient monitors
Findings: 
* The technologies are made up of numerous supporting features and similarly to gadgets, compile different health components and improve/find solutions to given health statuses. 
* These machines revolve around one’s specific health and thoroughly align with the guidelines of healthcare including treatments, cures, prevention, diagnosis…

### Engineering Design Process
I am still currently on the second step of the engineering design process which means that I'm further researching my given problem in step 1. I have already defined my problem which is the fear of adaptability. Biologically, humans often perceieve uncertainty as a threat which is why change is feared by many. Technology, particularly electronic, is a very recentley developed conception that's gradually taking over the globe. Multiple concerns arise from this rapid evolution (mostly the product of fear). Will AI surpass human beings? Will cybersecurity worsen with time? Is technology more harmful than helpful? Although these questions can't yet be fully answered, I'm left to finish my second step in the engineering design process which combines research to try to find any answers. Eventually, once I collect information on the given topic, I'll brainstorm and formulate a plan to create possible solutions to my problem. This will be the third step to the design engeering process.

### Skills
Although I'm in the raw stages of the freedom project, I've already aqquired a few beneficial skills, one of which covers project management. As I'm beginning to write my blog to documenet my project from start to finish, I learned to structure my work in a way that's easy to comprehend. Before working on my project, I found projects, especially essays, extremely challenging to organize. I wouldn't know how or when to transition from one subject to another. It was abundantly akward having to switch from a depressing to positive tone in my english class discussions for example. During the process of project management, I was forced to continuously practice connecting, layering, and modifying certain parts of my claim in order to align with my sub claims. In the end, this skill was able to earn me a better summative grade for english and continue to maintain an evident subject in my freedom project.

Another skill I was able to achieve through this project so far was decision making. I've always struggled making choices growing up. I found it hard to believe how people made roughly 35,000 decisions in a day when it took me hours to make a single one. As I've stated before, I was overly conflicted when given a list of occupations to choose from in the very beginning of the freedom project. I recognize now that I took too much time considering other minor details when I should've been focusing on the big picture. I had a similar problem with math. I would almost always overcomplicate my solution by using various formulas for a problem that simply required one. While it's of course helpful to finalize your work by using alternatives to check your methods, overanalyzing can overwwhelm you and in time drain you. Through this project, I learned to examine a situation to a certain degree which in turn helped my decision making. In terms of math, I was able to write down a straightforward answer making it easier for both me and my teacher's comprehension.

### Reflection
I look forward to gaining various other new skills throughout this project. I've learned more than I thought I was capable of. I hope I continue to surprise myself while also further fueling my passion for medicine.
