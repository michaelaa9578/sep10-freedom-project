### Content

For the final stretch of learning my tool, I conducted a 3 day plan which consists of:

On day one, I looked over past projects in which I have utilized my tool to get an idea of how and when to input code from my tool into my freedom project. I’ll use my learning logs, writeups, and projects (SHABR, bootstrap templates, etc.) to see how I incorporated my tool into those projects and how I linked bootstrap components from my SHABR project, for example, with code from my tool. Essentially, I’m revisiting my past work.
On day two, being that my tool focuses more so on 3D modeling rather than templates, I would end up drafting a simple, mini project which would revolve around exactly that. In this case, I would focus less on bootstrap templates, for example, being that bootstrap templates focus on organization of elements rather than the movement of elements. Earlier in the process of learning my tool, I used code like...

```html
<a-sphere position="0 1.25 -5" radius="1.25" color="#EF2D5E"></a-sphere>
<a-cylinder position="1 0.75 -3" radius="0.5" height="1.5" color="#FFC65D"></a-cylinder>
<a-plane position="0 0 -4" rotation="-90 0 0"
```
…which ended up creating various movements and 3D shapes. I’ll, thus, use code similar to this to create a more 3D output.
On day three, I worked to better recognize the connection between my topic of medicine with code snippets from my mini project so that I’m able to get an idea of the prototype I want to create for the final project. I often struggle with keeping my code relevant to my tool/topic so it’s important that I connect the dots to avoid forgetting the main picture. I can connect these ideas through a venn diagram or by putting different works side by side for an evident comparison.

###### Struggles

I struggled to actually input my tool into the code which I was using. In turn, I was unable to physically display the code to see what I was working with. I would continuosly add components blindly. This made it difficult to see what components were fit for what scenarios. 

```html
   <script src="https://aframe.io/releases/1.5.0/aframe.min.js"></script>
```


### Engineering Design Process

I have moved on to the fourth step of the engineering design process which means that I'm organizing my information to devise solutions to my given problem in step 1 (brainstorming). I have already brainstormed possible solutions which means that I have to plan the most efficient solution. During this part of the project, I begin to execute information which I have found through brainstorming. By testing these ideas, I'll be able to better structure a final solution to my topic of medicine by seeing which body of code is most effective. Once I complete testing out different code, I plan to create a prototype using my tool (step 5).

### Skills

One skill I was able to work on throughout this stage of the project was paying attention to detail. Having to pick a particular tool out of a wide variety of other tools required having to rule out certain aspects in my plan. For example, when looking through Tailwind (a tool), I had to focus on the type of code which was being utilized to gather an overall idea of the tool. Eventually, I realized that Tailwind, as I mentioned in my content, focused more so on organization rather than model designing which I happen to be more interested in and which Aframe (my chosen tool) was more involved with. Focusing on smaller components helped me in other situations outside of those in SEP. When I first started babysitting for my niece, I was solely focused on playing with her and making her happy, which even though her happiness is just as important, I should have also been focused on the smaller tasks such as regulalry cleaning her bowls, observing her sleep schedule, looking for any abnormal behaviors, etc. These smaller tasks make up for her overall development which I eventually realized in the midst of tinkering. Through tinkering, I'm now able to efficiently care for my niece resulting in her being both happy and healthy.

### Reflection

I look forward to continue finding new potential solutions even with an existing primary solution to ensure the continuation of medicine.
