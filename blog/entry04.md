Healthcare has enabled the prospering of civilizations since the beginning of time. Healthcare is a spectrum of concepts which conjoins factors including diagnosis, prevention, cures, treatments, etc. Tinkering with different tools is often practiced in the medical field to continue advancing these treatments which is why...

I tinkered with Aframe by using

```html
  <a-scene>
     <a-box position="-1 5 -3" rotation="90 90 90" color="#808080"></a-box>
     <a-sphere position="-1 3.5 -5" radius=".25" color="#FFFF00"></a-sphere>
     <a-cylinder position="-1 0.75 -3" radius="0.5" height="3" color="#0000FF"></a-cylinder>
     <a-plane position="0 0 -4" rotation="-90 0 0" width="4" height="4" color="#7BC8A4"></a-plane>
     <a-sky color="#FF0000"></a-sky>
  </a-scene>`
```

in [JS Bin](https://jsbin.com/diwajodedo/edit?html,output). This command inputs a certain model with different structuring based on the user’s input. I changed the background color, shapes of the given structures and their placement.This made me interested in Aframe because of the variety of code you get to utilize without the code being overwhelmingly difficult alongside the interactivity the model comes with in the output. A backup I have is Tailwind because the tool comes with the same spectrum of optimization (colors, placement, etc.), although I feel it’s slightly more focused on organization rather than model designing which I happen to be more engaged with.

I also tinkered with Tailwind by using

```html

      <div class="flex space-x-4">
        <button class="px-6 h-12 uppercase font-semibold tracking-wider border-2 border-black bg-teal-400 text-black" type="submit">
          Buy now
        </button>
        <button class="px-6 h-12 uppercase font-semibold tracking-wider border border-slate-200 text-slate-900" type="button">
          Add to bag
        </button>
        <button class="px-6 h-12 uppercase font-semibold tracking-wider border border-slate-200 text-slate-900" type="button">
          View cart
        </button>
      </div>

```
as well as

```html

        <label>
          <input class="sr-only peer" name="size" type="radio" value="xs" checked />
          <div class="relative w-10 h-10 flex items-center justify-center text-black peer-checked:bg-black peer-checked:text-white before:absolute before:z-[-1] before:top-0.5 before:left-0.5 before:w-full before:h-full peer-checked:before:bg-teal-400">
            XS
          </div>
        </label>
        <label>
          <input class="sr-only peer" name="size" type="checkbox" value="s" />
          <div class="relative w-10 h-10 flex items-center justify-center text-black peer-checked:bg-black peer-checked:text-white before:absolute before:z-[-1] before:top-0.5 before:left-0.5 before:w-full before:h-full peer-checked:before:bg-teal-400">
            S
          </div>
        </label>

```
once again in [JS Bin](https://jsbin.com/wojanetete/edit?html,output). In the first snippet, I added the button "add to cart" to two existing buttons. In the second snippet, I changed a few buttons to make them checkboxes instead of radio buttons. Through changing and testing these features, I realized that I was altering the way in which text was organized which only further pushed me towards working on Aframe as this tool was mostly focused on the structure of code whereas in comparison to Aframe, Aframe focused on physics and design (more of what I'm interested in). However, Tailwind does make up for a good backup tool as it consists of a variety of components such as shadows, colors, etc.

### Engineering Design Process

I have moved on to the fourth step of the engineering design process which means that I'm organizing my information to devise solutions to my given problem in step 1 (brainstorming). I have already brainstormed possible solutions which means that I have to plan the most efficient solution. During this part of the project, I begin to execute information which I have found through brainstorming. By testing these ideas, I'll be able to better structure a final solution to my topic of medicine by seeing which body of code is most effective. Once I complete testing out different code, I plan to create a prototype using my tool (step 5).

### Skills

One skill I was able to work on throughout this stage of the project was paying attention to detail. Having to pick a particular tool out of a wide variety of other tools required having to rule out certain aspects in my plan. For example, when looking through Tailwind (a tool), I had to focus on the type of code which was being utilized to gather an overall idea of the tool. Eventually, I realized that Tailwind, as I mentioned in my content, focused more so on organization rather than model designing which I happen to be more interested in and which Aframe (my chosen tool) was more involved with. Focusing on smaller components helped me in other situations outside of those in SEP. When I first started babysitting for my niece, I was solely focused on playing with her and making her happy, which even though her happiness is just as important, I should have also been focused on the smaller tasks such as regulalry cleaning her bowls, observing her sleep schedule, looking for any abnormal behaviors, etc. These smaller tasks make up for her overall development which I eventually realized in the midst of tinkering. Through tinkering, I'm now able to efficiently care for my niece resulting in her being both happy and healthy.

### Reflection

I look forward to continue finding new potential solutions even with an existing primary solution to ensure the continuation of medicine.
