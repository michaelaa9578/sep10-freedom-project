### Content

I tinkered with Aframe by using 

```html
  <a-scene>
     <a-box position="-1 5 -3" rotation="90 90 90" color="#808080"></a-box>
     <a-sphere position="-1 3.5 -5" radius=".25" color="#FFFF00"></a-sphere>
     <a-cylinder position="-1 0.75 -3" radius="0.5" height="3" color="#0000FF"></a-cylinder>
     <a-plane position="0 0 -4" rotation="-90 0 0" width="4" height="4" color="#7BC8A4"></a-plane>
     <a-sky color="#FF0000"></a-sky>
  </a-scene>`
```

in [JS Bin](https://jsbin.com/diwajodedo/edit?html,output). This command inputs a certain model with different structuring based on the user’s input. I changed the background color, shapes of the given structures and their placement.This made me interested in Aframe because of the variety of code you get to utilize without the code being overwhelmingly difficult alongside the interactivity the model comes with in the output. A backup I have is Tailwind because the tool comes with the same spectrum of optimization (colors, placement, etc.). 



Although I feel it’s slightly more focused on organization (being that it uses elements such as styles, typography, sizing, etc.) rather than model designing which I happen to be more engaged with. 

### Engineering Design Process

I have moved on to the fourth step of the engineering design process which means that I'm organizing my information to devise solutions to my given problem in step 1 (brainstorming). I have already defined my problem and researched it which leaves me in the planning stage. During this part of the project, I begin to consider potential solutions and organize my information in a way where different topics correlate themselves to form a new idea. Once I complete step three of the EDP, I plan to choose a final solution (step 4).

### Skills

One skill I was able to continuosly work on throughout this stage of the project was organization. By having to organize my healthcare apps and gadgets into ways which link to potenial solutions helped me to correlate other aspects outside of SEP. In my English class, for example, I was tasked to connect a colonial setting with modern characters. Being that the two concepts clealry contrast, having to connect them was bound to be difficult. After this project, however, I'm now capable of linking numerous varities. Now, I constantly combine tones, dialact, and other factors in character development and different plots. Another skill I was able to achieve through this project so far was creativity. With having to create correlations

### Reflection

I look forward to gaining various other new skills throughout this project. I've learned more than I thought I was capable of. I hope I continue to surprise myself while also further fueling my passion for medicine.
