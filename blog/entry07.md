### Content: 

I fulfilled all of the minimum viable products and I was able to make components in my project functional. This includes my navbar, which scrolls to a designated section of my project, my A-frame model, in which the camera is movable and my model is complete, and my images, which are present on my website. My content was also sufficient in providing adequate context to my research topic on medicine, I Incorporated my LOYO tool (Aframe). My website was also practical and original. Including the minimum requirements for my project was able to earn me a product score which I was satisfied with. I was able to complete most of my minimum viable products by asking many questions from my peers and teachers. I was also sufficient in my presentation in terms of the hook, coherence, presence, visuals, and conclusion. 

###### Struggles 

Although I feel generally accomplished in how my project turned out in the end, I feel that numerous improvements could be made. Throughout my presentation at the expo, where I had to present my project to my students and judges, I felt that I wasn't organized in providing my answers to their questions. I came prepared to only present my elevator pitch but didn't prepare any potential answers to the questions that the judges might have. When the moment came to answer their questions, my explanations came out disarranged or unclear. 

### Engineering Design Process

I finished the last few stages of the engineering design process which was to improve as needed alongside communicating the results. I improved my project by doing a gallery walk in class and receiving growth and glows from my peers. From the received feedback, I was able to acknowledge and work on issues about my project which I was sometimes completely unaware of. I communicated my results by presenting my project to my class as well as presenting my project at the expo. 

### Skills

I was able to improve both my presentation skills as well as my time management skills throughout the last few steps of my engineering design process. Presentation-wise, I worked on presenting given information, smoothly, in a moderate tone, and in an engaging way. I would struggle with these factors on a daily when it came to anything as simple as conversing with my friends or family members which is why I was initially nervous to present my project. After spending a good amount of time repeatedly practicing the presentation, I was practicing these components in a continuous pattern which is what enabled me to eventually improve upon them. From practicing the presentation, I was able to also improve my conversation skills outside of school presentations. My parents and friends are now able to better understand my perspective in a discussion whereas before, I had to constantly repeat myself to get a point across. As for my time management, I was able to further work on this skill also through repeatedly practicing my presentation at home. It was required of me to have my presentation be under a certain amount of minutes which forced me to pace myself not only during the presentation but in other aspects of my life. These aspects included pacing myself during my life after school. It was always difficult for me to find time between work and leisure. Most of the time, I would dedicate more time to leisure in comparison to work. Now, however, I'm able to balance the two and make time for both my homework and free time. This has resulted in me receiving better independent work grades for my classes while not being too overwhelmed at the same time being that I was giving myself a break.    

### Reflection 

I look forward to working on future projects where I can brainstorm more ideas relating to medicine or even create a physical prototype of one of my existing ideas.
